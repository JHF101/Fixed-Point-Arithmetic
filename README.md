# Fixed Point Arithmetic in C++
This was used as a learning exercise to gain insight into the use of fixed-point arithmetic operations in C++.

Namely:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

Div and Mod were also covered but using bitmasks.

Some tradeoffs between precision and speed are shown in the code. 

A timer was added to measure the time taken to execute a particular function.
